Code Repository for Natural Language Processing with Real World Projects, Published by Packt

Dear Students,

Welcome to my course on **Natural Language Processing with Real World Projects!**

This is an important lecture where I will be describing to you what flow you should be taking to complete this course.
In case you are a complete beginner to Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, then you are recommended to start from the Pre-req sections i.e., from Section 12 – Pre-req - Python Fundamentals down till the last section of the course i.e., Section 22 - Pre-req - Deep Learning Introduction. These sections will cover all the pre-requisites which are important to understand the Natural Language Processing concepts.

In case you are familiar with all those concepts, feel free to start from the first section i.e., Section 1 - Introduction to NLP and Regex till Section 11 - Advanced Semantic Processing Part-2 and skip the rest sections that are marked with ‘Pre-req’.

All the best!
